2,"            Hi,
I think there is some problem in numbering of the vertices while you 
generated the blockMeshDict file. This problem is either where you 
specify the boundary face or when you specify the blocks. 
Please check the file properly with a diagram of the pipe along with the
 vertices and I am sure you will find the mistake.

            Hi Ashish,<div>OpenFOAM is originally &nbsp;written in C++, but people have also used "" python "" for writing OpenFOAM codes. You can check out for PyFoam to get more idea. Other than this I don't think there is any other language which is used for openfoam codes.</div>

6,"Hi Dinesh,<br><br>Can you please explain to me where exactly do you get the error. From your query I can guess two reasons of you getting this error,<br><br><b>1 )</b> Your installation is not done properly, reinstall and check.<br><b>2 )</b> You may be trying to run ""icoFoam"" command from 0, constant or system directory, which happens with most of the beginners. You have to run it outside these directories.<br><br>Regards,<br>Rahul Joshi<br>"

            Hello Deepak,<br>I am sorry to inform you that OpenFOAM runs only on Linux OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it runs on all flavours of Linux like Ubuntu, Fedora and SuSE.&nbsp; More info is available on the OpenFOAM&nbsp; website <a href=""http://www.openfoam.org"" title="""" target=""_blank"">http://www.openfoam.org</a><br>

            Hi Deepak,<br><br>OpenFOAM software is not designed for running with Window, but there are some versions available for windows ( which can at times be tedious ) . You can rather install a VMWare / Virtual Box and run ubuntu without compromising your windows use. But I would strongly recommend you use Linux for OpenFOAM and in case of any difficulty of using linux you can go through the Spoken Tutorials for linux.<br>

            Hi Deepak,<br><br>As suggested by Rahul, you can use Virtual Box for installing Linux to run OpenFOAM . Alternatively you may install ubuntu along with windows OR make a bootable ubuntu USB which will act as a plug-in OS device and you may install OpenFOAM in that which will run work without disturbing your present files and OS.&nbsp; <br><br>The process for making bootable usb is given in the link:&nbsp;<div><a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows"" title="""" target=""_blank"">http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows</a><br>

            Another point, you can run the command &nbsp;"" icoFoam -help "" directly on the command terminal. There is no need to go inside OpenFOAM folder .

13,"<p>mysql_connect() and mysql_pconnect() both are working for database 
connection but with little difference. In mysql_pconnect(), ‘p’ stands 
for persistance connection.</p>
<p>When we are using mysql_connect() function, every time it is opening 
and closing the database connection, depending on the  request .</p>
<p>But in case of mysql_pconnect() function,<br>
First, when connecting, the function would  try to find a (persistent) 
connection that’s already open with the same host, username and 
password. If one is found, an identifier for it will be returned instead
 of opening a new connection.<br>
Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the 
execution of the script ends. Instead, the connection will remain open 
for future use (mysql_close() will not close connection established by 
mysql_pconnect()).</p>
<p>mysql_pconncet() is useful when you have a lot of traffice on your 
site. At that time for every request it will not open a connection but 
will take it from the pool. This will increase the efficiency of your 
site. But for general use mysql_connect() is best.</p>"
