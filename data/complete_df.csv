(http://www.oscad.in/data/kicadtongspice.py) please copy this file in the folder kicadtongspice (you can find this folder inside the main oscad folder). you can make a backup of the kicadtongspice.py already existing in this folder. once you are done with this, create your schematic using the component ""transfo"" under the ""device"" library in the schematic editor. change its reference to u. (it originally has a reference t). to change the reference, right click on it and choose edit component--> reference.now proceed with the usual analysis insertion and netlist conversionin the netlist conversion, it asks for the parameters of the transformer. you need to give the number of turns in the primary, secondary and the values for b-h table. if you do not input anything, it takes default values. these parameters are required as i have used the inductor couple-magnetic core model for transformer. to know more about this, i suggest you read the ngspice manual attached (pg nos.170 to 174) (http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf)after inputting the parameters, you can simulate the circuit. i have attached an example project that simulates a step-up transformer. (http://www.oscad.in/data/transformer.abc) this will help you get started. in the example project, primary turns = 310, secondary turns = 620, so the turns ratio is 1:2. you can see that the ratio of input to output voltage is also 1:2.please rename the file transformer.abc to transformer.zip and use.hope this helps. let me know if you have any issues/queries.rakhi",Oscad,Schematic-Creation-and-Simulation,"Video tutorial, Oscad, schematic, simulation, EDA, Ngspice, analysis, transient "

1925,1922.0,c langauge applications, can we use  c language for  interfacing  programming?,"if you mean ""user-interface"" programming, then c is not the ideal language for this.  there are much better languages for user-interface programming: java, tcl, etc.  if you mean ""hardware-interface"" programming, then c is definitely ideal, as it is fast and much closer to machine language than other languages.",C-and-Cpp,First-C-Program,"C Program, printf(), int main(), Compile, execute, Video Tutorial, C and C++."
1926,1923.0,gcc,why gcc command used?,"gcc implements the c/c++ standard properly, so it is used.  also, once you learn how to compile a program from command-line, then you become more aware of the compilation process, before your program is run on the machine.",C-and-Cpp,First-C-Program,"C Program, printf(), int main(), Compile, execute, Video Tutorial, C and C++."

[ for execution ] ","this is an advanced question.  to understand the answer, you need to understand the hierarchy of languages: hll, assembly code, machine language, etc.  to answer briefly, an object file contains machine code which is ""almost"" ready to run on a machine.  there may be some unresolved variables or functions, such as external variables or library functions.  a linker creates an executable which is fully ready to run on a machine.the above holds for compiled languages.  for interpreted languages, the interpreter (another program) reads the program written by the programmer and interprets it at run-time.  so there is no notion of object file in an interpreted language.",C-and-Cpp,First-C-Program,"C Program, printf(), int main(), Compile, execute, Video Tutorial, C and C++."
1929,1942.0,header file,what is the use of header files as used in c programming?,"header files are used to split a programmer's code into multiple independent files, and compile independently.  most of you are just learning to program in c, and hence your program will just be 1 file.  but real programs, like say linux source code, consists of thousands of files.  header files are a way of conveying relevant information from one portion of the code-base to another.  they are also used when a programmer uses libraries created by someone else.",C-and-Cpp,First-C-Program,"C Program, printf(), int main(), Compile, execute, Video Tutorial, C and C++."

2462,444.0,namespace??,"plz clarify the importance of ""using namespace  std"" in the cpp programming  code","namespacing is a way to wrap code into ""segments"" so that your code does not conflict with others. for example, lets say that i create a program for multiplying two numbers. i put the code in a function called:int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }now suppose, you use my code in your program. but your program also has a multiply function with the same signature. but the function does something different than mine. say:int multiply(int a, int b) { static int c = 0; c--; return a*b*c; }now that's a problem. how would you solve this problem? you could just change the name of your function, or mine, but what if there are thousand places where i used my function in my program that you imported. would you change all their names? that's not very smart. so to fix this problem, we have namespacing.consider my program, but this time, inside a namespace.namespace myprogram {int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }}now if you import my code in yours, and there's a function called multiply with the same signature in your code, there would be no conflicts. because, now, my function is now myprogram::multiply, inside a namespace. and if you want to use it, you will have to write myprogram::multiply(_arg1, _arg2);but what if your program does not have a multiply function? then it would be just a pain to write myprogram::multiply everytime you want to use my function. to fix this, we import the namespace in our prgram. to do so, we use the keyword ""using"". so:using namespace myprogram;adding this to the top of the code, will allow you to use the function multiply(_arg1, _arg2) anywhere below it without having to specify the namespace.in a similar way, ""std"" is the namespace of the standard library offered by c++. all c++ library functions and containers are enclosed inside the std namespace. so you put using namespace std; at the top of the code to use the library functions, containers, without specifying the namespace, such as cout, cin, vector, map, etc. these are actually std::cout, std::cin, std::vector, etc.try removing that line & then use ""cout"" to output and see what happens!",C-and-Cpp,First-Cpp-Program,"C++ program, compile, execute, common errors and their solution , int main(),C and C++, video tutorial"

","hi nathan,1. since icofoam is a transient solver the solver will keeps running. you have to check the residual values. if it reaches say 10^-5 you can stop the iterations manually. the solver won't stop and report solution is converged unlike the steady state solver. probably you can try use residual plot to have a clear view of the residues with number of iterations.2. the kinematic viscosity has been fixed based on reynold's number and not on thermodynamic property of the fluid. re = (velocity*characteristic length)/(kinematic viscosity). re = 10. v= 1 m/s and d = 0.1 m. which gives the kinematic viscosity to be 0.01.3. since we are calculating property based on reynold's number the viscosity is independent of thermodynamic property of the fluid used.regards,sathish",OpenFOAM,Simulating-flow-in-a-Lid-Driven-Cavity,"OpenFOAM , Lid Driven File Structure, Meshing the geometry, Plotting and Validating  results on spreadsheet, Paraview, video tutorial."

3532,452.0,application of array,what is an array ??,"in computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. an array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.[1][2][3] the simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.\r\nfor example, an array of 10 32-bit integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ... 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 \xd7 i.[4]\r\nthe memory address of the first element of an array is called first address or foundation address.\r\nbecause the mathematical concept of a matrix\r\n can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays \r\nare also sometimes called matrices. in some cases the term ""vector"" is \r\nused in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are more correctly the mathematical equivalent. arrays are often used to implement tables, especially lookup tables; the word table is sometimes used as a synonym of array.\r\narrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and \r\nare used by almost every program. they are also used to implement many \r\nother data structures, such as lists and strings. they effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. in most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.\r\narrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement\r\n to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. for that reason, the \r\nelements of an array data structure are required to have the same size \r\nand should use the same data representation. the set of valid index \r\ntuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element \r\naddressing formula) are usually,[3][5] but not always,[2] fixed while the array is in use.\r\nthe term array is often used to mean array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages\r\n that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be \r\nselected by one or more indices computed at run-time. array types are \r\noften implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they \r\nmay be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.\r\nthe term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or ""abstract array"", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or adt) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontents\r\n1 history2 applications3 element identifier and addressing formulas\r\n3.1 one-dimensional arrays3.2 multidimensional arrays3.3 dope vectors3.4 compact layouts3.5 resizing3.6 non-linear formulas\r\n4 efficiency\r\n4.1 comparison with other data structures\r\n5 dimension6 see also7 references\r\n\r\n\r\nhistorythe \r\nfirst digital computers used machine-language programming to set up and \r\naccess array structures for data tables, vector and matrix computations,\r\n and for many other purposes. john von neumann wrote the first array-sorting program (merge sort) in 1945, during the building of the first stored-program computer.[6]p. 159 array indexing was originally done by self-modifying code, and later using index registers and indirect addressing. some mainframes designed in the 1960s, such as the burroughs b5000 and its successors, used memory segmentation to perform index-bounds checking in hardware.[7]\r\nassembly languages generally have no special support for arrays, \r\nother than what the machine itself provides. the earliest high-level \r\nprogramming languages, including fortran (1957), lisp (1958), cobol (1960), and algol 60 (1960), had support for multi-dimensional arrays, and so has c (1972). in c++ (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime[3][5] as well as for runtime-flexible arrays.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis section needs expansion. you can help by adding to it. (may 2009)\r\n\r\n\r\napplicationsarrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables. many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.\r\narrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings, and vlists. array-based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient (implicit data structures), requiring little space overhead, but may have poor space complexity, particularly when modified, compared to tree-based data structures (compare a sorted array to a search tree).\r\none or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocation, particularly memory pool allocation. historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate ""dynamic memory"" portably.\r\narrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple if statements. they are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array. the array may contain subroutine pointers (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by switch statements) that direct the path of the execution.\r\nelement identifier and addressing formulaswhen data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative scalar integer. indexes are also called subscripts. an index maps the array value to a stored object.\r\nthere are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed:\r\n0 (zero-based indexing): the first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0.[8]1 (one-based indexing): the first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 1.[9]n (n-based indexing): the base index of an array can be freely chosen. usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.\r\narrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to \r\naccess an array using multiple indices. for example, a two-dimensional \r\narray a with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression a[1, 3] (in a row major language) or a[3, 1] (in a column major\r\n language) in the case of a zero-based indexing system. thus two indices\r\n are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional \r\narray, and n for an n-dimensional array.\r\nthe number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array.\r\nin standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some enumerated type), and the address of an element is computed by a ""linear"" formula on the indices.\r\none-dimensional arraysa\r\n one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear \r\narray. accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can \r\neither represent a row or column index.\r\nas an example consider the c declaration int anarrayname[10];\r\nsyntax : datatype anarrayname[sizeofarray];\r\nin the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the int type. in c, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case. for example, the expressions anarrayname[0] and anarrayname[9] are the first and last elements respectively.\r\nfor a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address b + c \xd7 i, where b is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the address increment or stride.\r\nif the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant b is simply the address of the first element of the array. for this reason, the c programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element ""zeroth"" rather than ""first"".\r\nhowever, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address b. for example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address b is replaced by b + 30c, then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35. if the numbering does not start at 0, the constant b may not be the address of any element.\r\nmultidimensional arraysfor multi dimensional array, the element with indices i,j would have address b + c \xb7 i + d \xb7 j, where the coefficients c and d are the row and column address increments, respectively.\r\nmore generally, in a k-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices i1, i2, ..., ik is\r\nb + c1 \xb7 i1 + c2 \xb7 i2 + ... + ck \xb7 ik.\r\nfor example: int a[2][3];\r\nthis means that array a has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the array is of\r\n integer type. here we can store 6 elements they are stored linearly but\r\n starting from first row linear then continuing with second row. the \r\nabove array will be stored as a11, a12, a13, a21, a22, a23.\r\nthis formula requires only k multiplications and k \r\nadditions, for any array that can fit in memory. moreover, if any \r\ncoefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by\r\n bit shifting.\r\nthe coefficients ck must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.\r\nif the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then b is the\r\n address of the element whose indices are all zero. as in the \r\none-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the\r\n base address b. thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing b by b + c1 - \u2212 3 c1\r\n will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, \r\nrespectively. taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like \r\nfortran 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical \r\ntradition while other languages (like fortran 90, pascal and algol) let \r\nthe user choose the minimum value for each index.\r\ndope vectorsthe addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension d, the base address b, and the increments c1, c2, ..., ck. it is often useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array's descriptor or stride vector or dope vector.[2][3]\r\n the size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed \r\nfor each index may also be included in the dope vector. the dope vector \r\nis a complete handle for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to procedures. many useful array slicing\r\n operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or \r\nreversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very \r\nefficiently by manipulating the dope vector.[2]\r\ncompact layoutsoften\r\n the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous \r\narea of memory. however, that is not necessary. even if arrays are \r\nalways created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations \r\nmay create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them.\r\nthere are two systematic compact layouts for a two-dimensional array. for example, consider the matrix\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          a\r\n        \r\n        =\r\n        \r\n          \r\n            [\r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  1\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  2\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  3\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  4\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  5\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  6\r\n                \r\n              \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  7\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  8\r\n                \r\n                \r\n

={\\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\\\4&5&6\\\\7&8&9\\end{bmatrix}}.}\r\n  \r\n\r\nin the row-major order\r\n layout (adopted by c for statically declared arrays), the elements in \r\neach row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a\r\n row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row:\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nin column-major order\r\n (traditionally used by fortran), the elements in each column are \r\nconsecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower \r\naddress than any of the elements of a consecutive column:\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n4\r\n7\r\n2\r\n5\r\n8\r\n3\r\n6\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nfor arrays with three or more indices, ""row major order"" puts in \r\nconsecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by\r\n one in the last index. ""column major order"" is analogous with respect to the first index.\r\nin systems which use processor cache or virtual memory,\r\n scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in \r\nconsecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. many \r\nalgorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a \r\npredictable order. a programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use \r\nthis information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each \r\narray. for example, when computing the product a\xb7b of two matrices, it would be best to have a stored in row-major order, and b in column-major order.\r\nresizingmain article: dynamic array\r\nstatic arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and \r\nconsequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. however, \r\nby allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to \r\nit, it is possible to effectively implement a dynamic version of an array; see dynamic array. if this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time.\r\nsome array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a \r\ncount of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or\r\n size. this effectively makes the array a dynamic array with a fixed maximum size or capacity; pascal strings are examples of this.\r\nnon-linear formulasmore complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. for a compact two-dimensional triangular array, for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2.\r\nefficiencyboth store and select take (deterministic worst case) constant time. arrays take linear (o(n)) space in the number of elements n that they hold.\r\nin an array with element size k and on a machine with a cache line size of b bytes, iterating through an array of n elements requires the minimum of ceiling(nk/b) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. this is roughly a factor of b/k better than the number of cache misses needed to access n\r\n elements at random memory locations. as a consequence, sequential \r\niteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration \r\nover many other data structures, a property called locality of reference (this does not mean however, that using a perfect hash or trivial hash within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in constant time). libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as memcpy) which can be used to move contiguous\r\n blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved \r\nthrough individual element access. the speedup of such optimized \r\nroutines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.\r\nmemory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element overhead.\r\n there may be a per-array overhead, e.g. to store index bounds, but this\r\n is language-dependent. it can also happen that elements stored in an \r\narray require less memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single word; such arrays are often called packed arrays. an extreme (but commonly used) case is the bit array, where every bit represents a single element. a single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.\r\narray accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism.",C-and-Cpp,Arrays,"PHP-and-MySQL, Arrays, Video tutorial."

3559,482.0,array basic question,why array indices start from 0 index?,the real reason why array index starts at zero goes back to the original creator of c language. it is actually related to how c language sees memory and elements placed in it. it uses these index to actually calculate where in memory that particular item is. if you are not interested in the math behind the calculation then just assume that it is easier to calculate the location of first element by using a zero based index ( however many c veteran can still argue that using a 1 for starting index is equally good). so it is just a design choice that c language creator made ( and were happy with it). i hope it helps.,C-and-Cpp,Arrays,"PHP-and-MySQL, Arrays, Video tutorial."

""assembly programming through arduino"" is the first tutorial in the intermediate level.  here we assume that the learner has already gone through the basic level tutorials and has a fair idea about how to work with arduino along with various other electronic components (leds, lcds, 7-segment display, etc.). 2) since the basic level tutorials explain everything in detail, we assume that by the time the learner reaches the intermediate level, very detailed explanation on how to create the circuit is not necessary.  3) we do not wish to imitate khan academy or any other online learning content provider.  the narrative style that we have chosen makes translation of our content into indian languages easier.  at present, we translate and dub our content into 22 indian languages. we have the largest collection of it training material in indian languages as compared to any other website.  so, for example, one can learn java in 17 indian languages and 1 international language & one can learn libreoffice writer in 15 indian languages and 3 international languages.

","the alternate way to create a hex file of your asm code in arduino is as follows:lets assume that we are uploading simple blink code to upload the code.1. once you write the code in arduino software, as usual you need to compile it to check whether the code is right. after doing that, click on file option in the above menu bar and then click on preferences.2. a new window will open. in this new window, tick the compilation box and then press ok button to save the changes.3. now, compile the code again. as we know after compilation, there are many commands in the black portion at bottom of the arduino screen.4.the last line of these commands is the link to your hex file.for me it is showing""c:\users\91810\appdata\local\temp\arduino_build_534626/blink.ino.hex""note: here, i have intentionally highlighted the hex part so the user gets to know which file they should be concentrating on.5. now, when you see this command, copy the link.6. paste this command on your computer address bar. before pressing enter, remove the double inverted commas from both sides of the link and also remove the name of the hex file i.e. blink.ion.hex7. so now the link will become:c:\users\91810\appdata\local\temp\arduino_build_534626/8. now press enter. a folder will open up. in that folder you will see the hex file of your asm code.if you are still not clear about the precedure, feel free to ask.thank you ",Arduino,Assembly-programming-through-Arduino,"arduino, arduino uno board, assembly program, compile and upload, seven segment display, decoder 7447 ic,  avra and avrdude installation, video tutorial, spoken tutorial"
