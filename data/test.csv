","hi nathan,1. since icofoam is a transient solver the solver will keeps running. you have to check the residual values. if it reaches say 10^-5 you can stop the iterations manually. the solver won't stop and report solution is converged unlike the steady state solver. probably you can try use residual plot to have a clear view of the residues with number of iterations.2. the kinematic viscosity has been fixed based on reynold's number and not on thermodynamic property of the fluid. re = (velocity*characteristic length)/(kinematic viscosity). re = 10. v= 1 m/s and d = 0.1 m. which gives the kinematic viscosity to be 0.01.3. since we are calculating property based on reynold's number the viscosity is independent of thermodynamic property of the fluid used.regards,sathish",OpenFOAM,Simulating-flow-in-a-Lid-Driven-Cavity,"OpenFOAM , Lid Driven File Structure, Meshing the geometry, Plotting and Validating  results on spreadsheet, Paraview, video tutorial."

5327,1356.0,list and tuple,the basic difference between list and tuple,"the key difference is that tuples are immutable. this means that you cannot change the values in a tuple once you have created it. this is a good feature to have in some data structures where you intend to not make any changes to certain parts. as a list is mutable, it can't be used as a key in a dictionary because dictionaries can use any immutable object as a key. thus, tuples can be used as dictionary keys if needed. if you try to modify a tuple in a permitted way it becomes two tuples: the original, which remains fo every scope other than yours, and your modified copy for your scope.http://net-informations.com/python/iq/immutable.htm",Python-3.4.3,Getting-started-with-Lists,"python, ipython, list, del, remove, append, video tutorial"
